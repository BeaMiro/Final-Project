        <h1>Air Quality Pollution (Micrograms per cubic meter)</h1>
        <p>Let us analyze how air quality and methane emissions are interconnected and how they may affect endangered species. In the visualization above, air quality is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (\(g/m^{3}\)), for particulate matter, PM2.5 (fine). This measurement indicates the mass of particles in a volume of air. Lower numbers indicate cleaner air and higher numbers indicate a worse quality of air which could lead to greater health risks for all organisms in that state. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards: an annual average of 9 µg/m constitutes a safe air quality. According to this standard, every state except for California has a safe amount of particles per cubic meter of air. By a large margin, California has the most polluted air and is wildly unsafe for organisms. This could be a major contributor to the large amount of endangered species in California- it is the state with the worst air quality and the most amount of endangered species. Yet, the amount of endangered species and air quality don't match up for the rest of these states. Therefore, this data alone may not be the most reliable in determining the main threats to endangered species.</p>

        <h1>Methane Emissions</h1>
        <p>The data visualization below shows the amount of methane emissions by state. The massive quantities of methane released into the atmosphere are measured in teragrams (Tg). 1 Tg equals 1 million grams. One of the largest contributors of methane emissions are livestock (cattle) and landfills- click the link above to see more about landfills in each of these states.This is one of the few visualizations in which California (a major outlier in terms of pollution due to forest fires) is not the state with the highest/worst amount of pollution. In this dataset, Texas is the state with the highest amount of methane emissions, followed by California. New York is the third state to have the highest methane emissions. In general, we can see that states in the Midwest show the lowest levels of methane emission.</p>

        <h1>Air Quality and Methane Emissions</h1>
        <p>Since methane emissions affect our atmosphere and therefore our air quality, we created a visualization comparing the two. As you can see, California stands out as an outlier, with the highest air pollution and second highest for methane emissions. Its bubble size also shows a high number of endangered species, suggesting that more polluted and more populated states may face higher numbers of endangered species. Texas has the highest methane emissions from cattle, reflecting on its livestock industry. However, the relationship between methane emissions and air quality pollution does not appear to be strong. Although Florida is ranked as the second state with the highest number of endangered species, methane emissions and air quality pollution are low. This suggests that the endangerment of animals in the state is driven by other factors. Overall, while air quality and methane emissions are major threats to the amount of endangered species in some states, other states' amount of endangered animals are likely influenced by different types of pollution.</p>
