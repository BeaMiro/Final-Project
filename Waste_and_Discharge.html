        <h1>Waste and Discharge</h1>
        <p>Landfills and Facility Waste Discharge are major pollutants. Not only do landfills contribute greatly to methane emissions, but they often leak and contaminate the surrounding environment. This is especially true for the pollutant waste that Major Facilities in these states discharge. Both the pollutant waste and toxic waste leak into our soil and surrounding bodies of water. This is likely a major threat to the largest category of endangered species: Flowering plants. Let us look at how each of these possible threats affect endangered species in the top 12 most populated states.</p>
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        <h2>Landfills</h2>
        <p>The first landfill visualization shows the amount of landfills in each state. The color and size of each bubble indicates how many landfills are in the top 12 most populated states. We can see that California has the most amount of landfills by a large margin, followed by Texas and North Carolina. The state with the least amount of landfills is New Jersey, likely due to its small area. Since landfills are a major contributor to methane emissions we can see that some of the data from the methane emissions visualization matches up with this landfills data(see air quality link for more info). In both data sets, some of the states with the most amount of landfills/methane emissions are Texas and California. In both data sets, New Jersey is the state with the least amount of landfills/methane emissions.
        The second visualization displays how many of the landfills in each state are still operational, meaning they are still taking in trash/waste. This shows us that just because certain states have the most amount of landfills does not mean they have the most amount of operational landfills. The states with the most amount of operational landfills are California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The state with the least amount of operational landfills is New Jersey. This indicates that California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia will soon have a more rapid increase in methane emissions than the other states. This could prove to be more of a threat to endangered animals in the future.</p>

        <h2>Major Facilities Waste Discharge</h2>
        <p>The data visualizations below depict information about the amount of pollutant waste and toxic waste that major facilities in these states discharge. By major facilities, we mean municipal wastewater treatment plants, industrial facilities, and various types of landfills. That's why this data is more broad than the data we just analyzed which pertains to only landfills. Overall pollutant pounds show the total amount of waste discharged from these major facilities. In the first data visualization, the state with the most amount of pollutant pound for year is New Jersey followed by Florida and Texas. This is very different from many of our other data sets where New Jersey is usually the state with the least amount of pollution. This time, North Carolina is the state with the least amount of pollutant pounds. This indicates that, while other forms of pollution don't threaten endangered species in New Jersey, the pollutants discharged from major facilities is the biggest threat. The same could be said for Florida.
        The amount of toxic waste discharged from major facilities, while a much less amount than pollutant pounds, is much more harmful to the environment. Toxic waste is much more potent and harmful to the land and water it leaks into. In the second data visualization, the state with the most amount of toxic waste (in pounds per year) is Ohio, followed by Pennsylvania and California. Meanwhile, the state with the least amount of toxic waste is North Carolina. Since this is the only data set so far in which Ohio has the most pollution, this could indicate that toxic waste is the primary threat to endangered species in this state.</p>
