        <h1>Waste and Discharge</h1>
        <p>Landfills and Fecility Waste Discharge are major pollutants. Not only do landfills contribute greatly to methane emissions, but they often leak and contaminate the surrounding environment. This is especially true for the pollutant waste that Major Facilities in these states discharge. Both the pollutant waste and toxic waste leak into our soil and surrounding bodies of water. This is likely a major threat to the largest category of endangered species: Flowering plants. Let us look at how each of these possible threats affect endangered species in the top 12 most populated states.</p>
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        <h2>Landfills</h2>
        <p>The first landfill visualization shows the amount of landfills in each state. The color and size of each bubble indicates how many landfills are in the top 12 most populated states. We can see that California has the most amount of landfills by a large margin, followed by Texas and North Carolina. The state with the least amount of landfills is New Jersey, likely due to its small area. Since landfills are a major contributor to methane emissions we can see that some of the data from the methane emissions visualization matches up with this landfills data(see air quality link for more info). In both data sets, some of the states with the most amount of landfills/methane emissions are Texas and California. In both data sets, New Jersey is the state with the least amount of landfills/methane emissions.
        The second visualization displays how many of the landfills in each state are still operational, meaning they are still taking in trash/waste. This shows us that just because certain states have the most amount of landfills does not mean they have the most amount of operational landfills. The states with the most amount of operational landfills are California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The state with the least amount of operational landfills is New Jersey. This indicates that California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia will soon have a more rapid increase in methane emissions than the other states. This could prove to be more of a threat to endangered animals in the future.</p>

        <h2>Major Facilities Waste Discharge</h2>
        <p>In the bar graph below, the height of the bar for each state indicates the amount of endangered species for that state and the color indicates the state's population. Using this visualization, we can see that California has the highest population and almost double the amount of endangered species when compared to the other states. Meanwhile, Florida has more endangered species than Texas despite having a smaller population, showing that it may have more sensitive biodiversity or larger threats. Although states like Georgia and Virginia have smaller populations than states such as New York or Pennsylvania, they have a higher number of endangered species. This indicates that population size alone is not a reliable factor in explaining the number of endangered species. For this reason, we intend to look into different types of pollution to find a more reliable explanation for the number of endangered species.</p>
