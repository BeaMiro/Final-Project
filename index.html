         <h1>Threats to Endangered Species</h1>
        <p>This website aims to analyze and identify possible threats contributing to the amount of endangered species in the top 12 most populated states. We aim to do so by comparing the amount of endangered species in each of these states with the amount of: landfills, methane emissions, tree cover loss, air quality, and toxic pollutant discharges from major facilities in these states. Click the links above to see how we compare and analyze these possible contributors. The endangerment of so many species is an issue that affects our planet and therefore our quality of life. We aim to bring to light the most influential types of pollution that contribute to the endangerment of these species. By doing so, it will be easier for activists and policy makers to devote their resources to lessening the type of pollution that harms our planet the most.</p>

        <h2>Most Endangered Organisms</h2>
        <p>By looking into the categories of endangered organisms in each of the 12 most populated states, we were able to identify the types of organisms that are the most and least endangered. The most endangered organism is: Flowering Plants. This could indicate that the types of pollution most affecting endangered species are land and water pollutants since flowering plants depend on soil and water the most to survive. The second and third most endangered organisms are clams and birds respectively. This could indicate that water and air quality are also major factors that affect endangered species. The organisms that are the least endangered are Lichens which are a type of organism formed when a fungus and plant (usually a type of tree) form a symbiotic relationship. This could indicate that trees are the least affected by pollution.</p>

        <h2>Population and Endangered Animals</h2>
        <p> In the bar graph below, the height of the bar for each state indicates the amount of endangered species for that state and the color indicates the state's population. Using this visualization, we can see that California has the highest population and almost double the amount of endangered species when compared to the other states. Meanwhile, Florida has more endangered species than Texas despite having a smaller population, showing that it may have more sensitive biodiversity or larger threats. Although states like Georgia and Virginia have smaller populations than states such as New York or Pennsylvania, they have a higher number of endangered species. This indicates that population size alone is not a reliable factor in explaining the number of endangered species. For this reason, we intend to look into different types of pollution to find a more reliable explanation for threats that contribute to the  number of endangered species.
